                Jan-April </br>
                I attended a boot camp of Web Development at Valley Tech Academy where my journey into the tech world door has opened. I learned from scratch and progressed on making project and extra activites hands on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Laravel. I worked with teams on creating mock ups on API's, websites, and created miniture games. On the side I overshadowed the work of UX Design and extended my knowledge on studying more outside of class and seeing Udemy videos to strengthen my experience.
